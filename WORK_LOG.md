I also made a set for the "seen", so I could avoid repeats also in constant time. From there I just had to iterate through the text, adding to my seen set each time. I also had to use an Arraylist because I needed the order of the misspelled words to stay the same. After that, I just converted the arraylist back to an array, and returned that array of misspelled word. Sets were the first solution I thought of, and it worked to solve the code, although it is very memory inefficient. |

It was a bit confusing to initialize functions in the classes but I figured it out eventually. I yet again had to use an arraylist to store the incorrectly spelled words. Now, think my Node class and the main code is correct, but there is still an error in the Trie class that makes most of the cases fail. |

After going line by line, I couldn't find anything wrong with it. Finally, after printing each character before the code gave me errors, I realize I forgot to factor in for characters that are not letters. From there it was a simple fix, just changing my array size from 26 to 255 and changing how I indexed my characters. After that, it worked well. |

At first, I wanted to reuse the node class that I was originally using for the Trie, but I realized that simply creating a new class specifically for TST nodes would most likely be much easier not only to code but also to understand. Then, I worked on writing the Insert function for the TST which wasn't too hard. However, when trying to write the lookup function I got kind of stuck and confused, so I just left it there. I will continue next class to work on it. |

Now it is a little easier to troubleshoot. I started working on my TST functions as well, and I still had some errors. A few things I realized were that I was iterating through the word with a for loop instead of using a while loop. After looking at the sample TST on the slides and with some help from Mr. Blick, I realized that most of the time it will take more steps than the length of the word to actually look it up and/or put it into the TST. |
| October 6    |   8:40pm - 9:09pm   | I was doing more troubleshooting and I finally got it to work. The first issue I had was an infinite loop in my while loop because I accidentally was making the next node at i+1 instead of i. This caused the condition of the letter equally the middle node to never be true, meaning i was stuck at 0 and the while loop was infinte. After that, I still had errors in the test cases. Finally, I realized that I was iterating i BEFORE creating the new node, causing the new node to be one letter after my desired one. I was using the debugger to figure this out and it was definitely very helpful. By just moving the i++ line down my like 3 lines, the code was able to work and I passed all test cases with pretty good efficiency.  |
