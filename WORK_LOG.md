| September 24 | 11:15am - 11:48am |  The first thing I thought of was to use a set to store the dictionary, as it has constant time lookups. I also made a set for the "seen", so I could avoid repeats also in constant time. From there I just had to iterate through the text, adding to my seen set each time. I also had to use an Arraylist because I needed the order of the misspelled words to stay the same. After that, I just converted the arraylist back to an array, and returned that array of misspelled word. Sets were the first solution I thought of, and it worked to solve the code, although it is very memory inefficient. |
