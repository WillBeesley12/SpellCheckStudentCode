| September 24 | 11:15am - 11:48am  | The first thing I thought of was to use a set to store the dictionary, as it has constant time lookups. I also made a set for the "seen", so I could avoid repeats also in constant time. From there I just had to iterate through the text, adding to my seen set each time. I also had to use an Arraylist because I needed the order of the misspelled words to stay the same. After that, I just converted the arraylist back to an array, and returned that array of misspelled word. Sets were the first solution I thought of, and it worked to solve the code, although it is very memory inefficient. |

It was a bit confusing to initialize functions in the classes but I figured it out eventually. I yet again had to use an arraylist to store the incorrectly spelled words. Now, think my Node class and the main code is correct, but there is still an error in the Trie class that makes most of the cases fail. |

After going line by line, I couldn't find anything wrong with it. Finally, after printing each character before the code gave me errors, I realize I forgot to factor in for characters that are not letters. From there it was a simple fix, just changing my array size from 26 to 255 and changing how I indexed my characters. After that, it worked well. |

At first, I wanted to reuse the node class that I was originally using for the Trie, but I realized that simply creating a new class specifically for TST nodes would most likely be much easier not only to code but also to understand. Then, I worked on writing the Insert function for the TST which wasn't too hard. However, when trying to write the lookup function I got kind of stuck and confused, so I just left it there. I will continue next class to work on it.  |
